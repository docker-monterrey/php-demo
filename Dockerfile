#
# I: Runtime Stage: ============================================================
# This is the stage where we build the runtime base image, which is used as the
# common ancestor by the rest of the stages, and contains the minimal runtime
# dependencies required for the application to run in production:

# Step 1: Use the official PHP 7.3.x Alpine image as base:
FROM php:7.3-fpm-alpine AS runtime

# Step 2: We'll set '/usr/src' path as the working directory:
WORKDIR /usr/src

# Step 3: We'll set the working dir as HOME and add the app's binaries path to
# $PATH:
ENV HOME=/usr/src \
    COMPOSER_HOME=/usr/local/composer \
    PATH=/usr/src/bin:/usr/src/vendor/bin:/usr/local/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH

# Step 4: Install the common runtime dependencies:
RUN apk add --no-cache \
  ca-certificates \
  less \
  libzip \
  mariadb-client \
  nginx \
  openssl \
  supervisor \
  su-exec \
  tzdata \
  zlib

# II: Development Stage: =======================================================
# In this stage we'll build the image used for development, including compilers,
# and development libraries. This is also a first step for building a releasable
# Docker image:

# Step 5: Start off from the "runtime" stage:
FROM runtime AS development

# Step 6: Install the development dependency packages with alpine package
# manager:
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    build-base \
    chromium \
    chromium-chromedriver \
    git \
    libzip-dev \
    mariadb-dev \
    nodejs \
    npm \
    yarn \
    zlib-dev

# Step 7: Fix npm uid-number error
# - see https://github.com/npm/uid-number/issues/7
RUN npm config set unsafe-perm true

# Step 8: Install the 'check-dependencies' node package:
RUN npm install -g check-dependencies

# Step 9: Install PHP packages required by laravel:
RUN set -ex && docker-php-ext-install \
  bcmath \
  pdo_mysql \
  zip

# Step 10: Install composer:
RUN set -ex \
 && export COMPOSER_VERSION=1.8.4 \
 && export COMPOSER_SHA256=1722826c8fbeaf2d6cdd31c9c9af38694d6383a0f2bf476fe6bbd30939de058a \
 && curl -o /usr/local/bin/composer "https://getcomposer.org/download/${COMPOSER_VERSION}/composer.phar" \
 && echo "${COMPOSER_SHA256}  /usr/local/bin/composer" | sha256sum -c - \
 && chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/composer

ARG DEVELOPER_USER="you"
ARG DEVELOPER_UID="1000"

RUN adduser -D -u $DEVELOPER_UID $DEVELOPER_USER \
 && addgroup $DEVELOPER_USER wheel

ENV DEVELOPER_USER=$DEVELOPER_USER

# Step X: Create the COMPOSER_HOME directory (where the global packages will be
# in):
RUN mkdir -p $COMPOSER_HOME \
 && chgrp wheel $COMPOSER_HOME \
 && chmod g+rws $COMPOSER_HOME

# Stage III: Testing
FROM development AS testing

# Step X: Copy the composer files to a temporary folder, in preparation of
# composer install
COPY composer.* package.json yarn.lock /usr/src/

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/vendor /usr/src/node_modules

# We'll run 'composer install' without pluugins nor scripts -
# see https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-untrusted-packages-safely.md
RUN composer install \
    --ignore-platform-reqs \
    --no-autoloader \
    --no-interaction \
    --no-plugins \
    --no-scripts \
    --prefer-dist

RUN yarn install

# Step 13: Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . /usr/src/

# IV: Builder stage: ===========================================================
# In this stage we'll compile assets coming from the project's source, remove
# development libraries, and other cleanup tasks, in preparation for the final
# "release" image:

# Step 15: Start off from the development stage image:
FROM testing AS builder

# Step 16: Precompile assets and remove compiled source code:
RUN yarn production && rm -rf resources/js resources/sass

# Step 17: Remove installed composer libraries that belong to the development
# group - we'll copy the remaining composer libraries into the deployable image
# on the next stage - see https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/deployment#optimization:
RUN rm -rf bin/composer \
 && composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev

# Step 18: Remove files not used on release image:
RUN rm -rf \
    .config \
    .env.exampleÂ \
    .npm \
    .npmrc \
    bin/dev-entrypoint.sh \
    node_modules \
    php.tar.* \
    tests \
    tmp/* \
    webpack.mix.js \
    yarn.lock

# V: Release stage: ============================================================
# In this stage, we build the final, deployable Docker image, which will be
# smaller than the images generated on previous stages:

# Step 19: Start off from the runtime stage image:
FROM runtime AS release

# Copy the previously-compiled PHP extensions & their configurations:
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/php/extensions /usr/local/lib/php/extensions
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d

# Step 20: Copy from app code from the "builder" stage, which at this point
# should have the assets from the asset pipeline already compiled:
COPY --from=builder --chown=www-data:www-data /usr/src /usr/src

# Step 22: Set the APP_ENV and PORT default values:
ENV APP_ENV=production PORT=8000

# Step 23: Generate the temporary directories in case they don't already exist:
RUN su-exec www-data mkdir -p /usr/src/tmp/pids /usr/src/tmp/sockets

# Step 25: Set the default command:
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/src/bin/entrypoint.sh" ]
CMD [ "web" ]

# Step 26 thru 30: Add label-schema.org labels to identify the build info:
ARG SOURCE_BRANCH="master"
ARG SOURCE_COMMIT="000000"
ARG BUILD_DATE="2017-09-26T16:13:26Z"
ARG IMAGE_NAME="vovimayhem/php-demo:latest"

LABEL org.label-schema.build-date=$BUILD_DATE \
      org.label-schema.name="Vovimayhem's Laravel Demo" \
      org.label-schema.description="Vovimayhem's Laravel Demo" \
      org.label-schema.vcs-url="https://github.com/docker-monterrey/php-demo.git" \
      org.label-schema.vcs-ref=$SOURCE_COMMIT \
      org.label-schema.schema-version="1.0.0-rc1" \
      build-target="release" \
      build-branch=$SOURCE_BRANCH
